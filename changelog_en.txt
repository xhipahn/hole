== 23.12.2019 ==

Extractor: 2nd pass now faster on frames where faces are not found

all models: removed options 'src_scale_mod', and 'sort samples by yaw as target'
If you want, you can manually remove unnecessary angles from src faceset after sort by yaw.

Optimized sample generators (CPU workers). Now they consume less amount of RAM and work faster.

added 
4.2.other) data_src/dst util faceset pack.bat

added
4.2.other) data_src util faceset metadata save.bat
	saves metadata of data_src\aligned\ faces into data_src\aligned\meta.dat

4.2.other) data_src util faceset metadata restore.bat
	restore metadata from 'meta.dat' to images
	if image size different from original, then it will be automatically resized

You can greatly enhance face details of src faceset by using Topaz Gigapixel software.
example before/after https://i.imgur.com/Gwee99L.jpg
Download it from torrent https://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5757118
Example of workflow:

1) run 'data_src util faceset metadata save.bat'
2) launch Topaz Gigapixel
3) open 'data_src\aligned\' and select all images
4) set output folder to 'data_src\aligned_topaz' (create folder in save dialog)
5) set settings as on screenshot https://i.imgur.com/kAVWMQG.jpg
	you can choose 2x, 4x, or 6x upscale rate
6) start process images and wait full process
7) rename folders:
	data_src\aligned        ->  data_src\aligned_original
	data_src\aligned_topaz  ->  data_src\aligned
8) copy 'data_src\aligned_original\meta.dat' to 'data_src\aligned\'
9) run 'data_src util faceset metadata restore.bat'
	images will be downscaled back to original size (256x256) preserving details
	metadata will be restored
10) now your new enhanced faceset is ready to use !

SAEHD,Quick96:
improved model generalization, overall accuracy and sharpness 
by using new 'Learning rate dropout' technique from the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00144
An example of a loss histogram where this function is enabled after the red arrow:
https://i.imgur.com/3olskOd.jpg


== 12.12.2019 ==

removed FacesetRelighter due to low quality of the result 

added sort by absdiff
This is sort method by absolute per pixel difference between all faces.
options:
Sort by similar? ( y/n ?:help skip:y ) :
if you choose 'n', then most dissimilar faces will be placed first.

'sort by final' renamed to 'sort by best'

OpenCL: fix extractor for some amd cards

== 14.11.2019 ==

Converter: added new color transfer mode: mix-m

== 13.11.2019 ==

SAE,SAEHD,Converter:
added sot-m color transfer

Converter:
removed seamless2 mode

FacesetRelighter:
Added intensity parameter to the manual picker.
'One random direction' and 'predefined 7 directions' use random intensity from 0.3 to 0.6.

== 12.11.2019 ==

FacesetRelighter fixes and improvements:

now you have 3 ways:
1) define light directions manually (not for google colab)
   watch demo https://youtu.be/79xz7yEO5Jw
2) relight faceset with one random direction
3) relight faceset with predefined 7 directions

== 11.11.2019 ==

added FacesetRelighter:
Synthesize new faces from existing ones by relighting them using DeepPortraitRelighter network.
With the relighted faces neural network will better reproduce face shadows.

Therefore you can synthsize shadowed faces from fully lit faceset.
https://i.imgur.com/wxcmQoi.jpg

as a result, better fakes on dark faces:
https://i.imgur.com/5xXIbz5.jpg

operate via
data_x add relighted faces.bat
data_x delete relighted faces.bat

in OpenCL build Relighter runs on CPU

== 09.11.2019 ==

extractor: removed "increased speed of S3FD" for compatibility reasons

converter: 
fixed crashes
removed useless 'ebs' color transfer
changed keys for color degrade

added image degrade via denoise - same as denoise extracted data_dst.bat , 
but you can control this option directly in the interactive converter

added image degrade via bicubic downscale/upscale 

SAEHD: 
default ae_dims for df now 256. It is safe to train SAEHD on 256 ae_dims and higher resolution.
Example of recent fake: https://youtu.be/_lxOGLj-MC8

added Quick96 model.
This is the fastest model for low-end 2GB+ NVidia and 4GB+ AMD cards. 
Model has zero options and trains a 96pix fullface.
It is good for quick deepfake demo.
Example of the preview trained in 15 minutes on RTX2080Ti:

fix message when no training data provided

== 23.10.2019 ==

enhanced sort by final: now faces are evenly distributed not only in the direction of yaw, 
but also in pitch

added 'sort by vggface': sorting by face similarity using VGGFace model. 
Requires 4GB+ VRAM and internet connection for the first run.


== 19.10.2019 ==

fix extractor bug for 11GB+ cards

== 15.10.2019 ==

removed fix "fixed bug when the same face could be detected twice"

SAE/SAEHD:
removed option 'apply random ct'

added option 
   Color transfer mode apply to src faceset. ( none/rct/lct/mkl/idt, ?:help skip: none )
   Change color distribution of src samples close to dst samples. Try all modes to find the best.
before was lct mode, but sometime it does not work properly for some facesets.


== 14.10.2019 ==

fixed bug when the same face could be detected twice

Extractor now produces a less shaked face. but second pass is now slower by 25%
before/after: https://imgur.com/L77puLH

SAE, SAEHD: 'random flip' and 'learn mask' options now can be overridden.
It is recommended to start training for first 20k iters always with 'learn_mask'

SAEHD: added option Enable random warp of samples, default is on
Random warp is required to generalize facial expressions of both faces. 
When the face is trained enough, you can disable it to get extra sharpness for less amount of iterations.

== 10.10.2019 ==

fixed wrong NVIDIA GPU detection in extraction and training processes

increased speed of S3FD 1st pass extraction for GPU with >= 11GB vram.

== 09.10.2019 ==

fixed wrong NVIDIA GPU indexes in a systems with two or more GPU
fixed wrong NVIDIA GPU detection on the laptops

removed TrueFace model.

added SAEHD model ( High Definition Styled AutoEncoder )
Compare with SAE: https://i.imgur.com/3QJAHj7.jpg
This is a new heavyweight model for high-end cards to achieve maximum possible deepfake quality in 2020.

Differences from SAE:
+ new encoder produces more stable face and less scale jitter
+ new decoder produces subpixel clear result
+ pixel loss and dssim loss are merged together to achieve both training speed and pixel trueness
+ by default networks will be initialized with CA weights, but only after first successful iteration
  therefore you can test network size and batch size before weights initialization process
+ new neural network optimizer consumes less VRAM than before
+ added option <Enable 'true face' training>
  The result face will be more like src and will get extra sharpness.
  Enable it for last 30k iterations before conversion.
+ encoder and decoder dims are merged to one parameter encoder/decoder dims
+ added mid-full face, which covers 30% more area than half face.  

example of the preview trained on RTX2080TI, 128 resolution, 512-21 dims, 8 batch size, 700ms per iteration:

== 19.09.2019 ==

SAE : WARNING, RETRAIN IS REQUIRED ! 
fixed model sizes from previous update. 
avoided bug in ML framework(keras) that forces to train the model on random noise.

Converter: added blur on the same keys as sharpness

Added new model 'TrueFace'. Only for NVIDIA cards.
This is a GAN model ported from https://github.com/NVlabs/FUNIT
Model produces near zero morphing and high detail face.
Model has higher failure rate than other models.
It does not learn the mask, so fan-x mask modes should be used in the converter.
Keep src and dst faceset in same lighting conditions. 

== 13.09.2019 ==

Converter: added new color transfer modes: mkl, mkl-m, idt, idt-m

SAE: removed multiscale decoder, because it's not effective

== 07.09.2019 ==

Extractor: fixed bug with grayscale images.

Converter:

Session is now saved to the model folder.

blur and erode ranges are increased to -400+400

hist-match-bw is now replaced with seamless2 mode.

Added 'ebs' color transfer mode (works only on Windows).

FANSEG model (used in FAN-x mask modes) is retrained with new model configuration
and now produces better precision and less jitter

== 30.08.2019 ==

interactive converter now saves the session.
if input frames are changed (amount or filenames)
then interactive converter automatically starts a new session.
if model is more trained then all frames will be recomputed again with their saved configs.

== 28.08.2019 ==

removed landmarks of lips which are used in face aligning
result is less scale jittering
before  https://i.imgur.com/gJaW5Y4.gifv

converter: fixed merged\ filenames, now they are 100% same as input from data_dst\

converted to X.bat : now properly eats any filenames from merged\ dir as input

== 27.08.2019 ==

fixed converter navigation logic and output filenames in merge folder

added EbSynth program. It is located in _internal\EbSynth\ folder
Start it via 10) EbSynth.bat
It starts with sample project loaded from _internal\EbSynth\SampleProject
EbSynth is mainly used to create painted video, but with EbSynth you can fix some weird frames produced by deepfake process.

updated pdf manuals for AVATAR model.

Avatar converter: added super resolution option.

All converters:
fixes and optimizations
super resolution DCSCN network is now replaced by RankSRGAN
added new option sharpen_mode and sharpen_amount

== 25.08.2019 ==

Converter: FAN-dst mask mode now works for half face models.

AVATAR Model: default avatar_type option on first startup is now HEAD. 
Head produces much more stable result than source.

updated usage of AVATAR model:
Usage:
1) place data_src.mp4 10-20min square resolution video of news reporter sitting at the table with static background,
   other faces should not appear in frames.
2) process "extract images from video data_src.bat" with FULL fps
3) place data_dst.mp4 square resolution video of face who will control the src face
4) process "extract images from video data_dst FULL FPS.bat"
5) process "data_src mark faces S3FD best GPU.bat"
6) process "data_dst extract unaligned faces S3FD best GPU.bat"
7) train AVATAR.bat stage 1, tune batch size to maximum for your card (32 for 6GB), train to 50k+ iters.
8) train AVATAR.bat stage 2, tune batch size to maximum for your card (4 for 6GB), train to decent sharpness.
9) convert AVATAR.bat
10) converted to mp4.bat

== 24.08.2019 ==

Added interactive converter.
With interactive converter you can change any parameter of any frame and see the result in real time.

Converter: added motion_blur_power param. 
Motion blur is applied by precomputed motion vectors. 
So the moving face will look more realistic.

RecycleGAN model is removed.

Added experimental AVATAR model. Minimum required VRAM is 6GB for NVIDIA and 12GB for AMD.


== 16.08.2019 ==

fixed error "Failed to get convolution algorithm" on some systems
fixed error "dll load failed" on some systems

model summary is now better formatted

Expanded eyebrows line of face masks. It does not affect mask of FAN-x converter mode.
ConverterMasked: added mask gradient of bottom area, same as side gradient

== 23.07.2019 ==

OpenCL : update versions of internal libraries

== 20.06.2019 ==

Trainer: added option for all models
Enable autobackup? (y/n ?:help skip:%s) : 
Autobackup model files with preview every hour for last 15 hours. Latest backup located in model/<>_autobackups/01

SAE: added option only for CUDA builds:
Enable gradient clipping? (y/n, ?:help skip:%s) : 
Gradient clipping reduces chance of model collapse, sacrificing speed of training.

== 02.06.2019 ==

fix error on typing uppercase values

== 10.05.2019 ==

fixed work of model pretraining

== 08.05.2019 ==

SAE: added new option 
Apply random color transfer to src faceset? (y/n, ?:help skip:%s) : 
Increase variativity of src samples by apply LCT color transfer from random dst samples.
It is like 'face_style' learning, but more precise color transfer and without risk of model collapse, 
also it does not require additional GPU resources, but the training time may be longer, due to the src faceset is becoming more diverse.

== 05.05.2019 ==

OpenCL: SAE model now works properly

== 05.03.2019 ==

fixes

SAE: additional info in help for options:

Use pixel loss - Enabling this option too early increases the chance of model collapse.
Face style power - Enabling this option increases the chance of model collapse.
Background style power - Enabling this option increases the chance of model collapse.


== 05.01.2019 == 

SAE: added option 'Pretrain the model?'

Pretrain the model with large amount of various faces. 
This technique may help to train the fake with overly different face shapes and light conditions of src/dst data. 
Face will be look more like a morphed. To reduce the morph effect, 
some model files will be initialized but not be updated after pretrain: LIAE: inter_AB.h5 DF: encoder.h5. 
The longer you pretrain the model the more morphed face will look. After that, save and run the training again.


== 04.28.2019 ==

fix 3rd pass extractor hang on AMD 8+ core processors

Converter: fixed error with degrade color after applying 'lct' color transfer

added option at first run for all models: Choose image for the preview history? (y/n skip:n)
Controls: [p] - next, [enter] - confirm.

fixed error with option sort by yaw. Remember, do not use sort by yaw if the dst face has hair that covers the jaw.

== 04.24.2019 ==

SAE: finally the collapses were fixed

added option 'Use CA weights? (y/n, ?:help skip: %s ) : 
Initialize network with 'Convolution Aware' weights from paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06295.
This may help to achieve a higher accuracy model, but consumes a time at first run.

== 04.23.2019 ==

SAE: training should be restarted
remove option 'Remove gray border' because it makes the model very resource intensive.

== 04.21.2019 ==

SAE: 
fix multiscale decoder.
training with liae archi should be restarted

changed help for 'sort by yaw' option:
NN will not learn src face directions that don't match dst face directions. Do not use if the dst face has hair that covers the jaw.


== 04.20.2019 ==

fixed work with NVIDIA cards in TCC mode

Converter: improved FAN-x masking mode.
Now it excludes face obstructions such as hair, fingers, glasses, microphones, etc.
example https://i.imgur.com/x4qroPp.gifv
It works only for full face models, because there were glitches in half face version.

Fanseg is trained by using manually refined by MaskEditor >3000 various faces with obstructions.
Accuracy of fanseg to handle complex obstructions can be improved by adding more samples to dataset, but I have no time for that :(
Dataset is located in the official mega.nz folder.
If your fake has some complex obstructions that incorrectly recognized by fanseg,
you can add manually masked samples from your fake to the dataset
and retrain it by using --model DEV_FANSEG argument in bat file. Read more info in dataset archive.
Minimum recommended VRAM is 6GB and batch size 24 to train fanseg.
Result model\FANSeg_256_full_face.h5 should be placed to DeepFacelab\facelib\ folder

Google Colab now works on Tesla T4 16GB.
With Google Colaboratory you can freely train your model for 12 hours per session, then reset session and continue with last save.
more info how to work with Colab: https://github.com/chervonij/DFL-Colab

== 04.07.2019 == 

Extractor: added warning if aligned folder contains files that will be deleted.

Converter subprocesses limited to maximum 6

== 04.06.2019 ==

added experimental mask editor. 
It is created to improve FANSeg model, but you can try to use it in fakes.
But remember: it does not guarantee quality improvement.
usage:
run 5.4) data_dst mask editor.bat
edit the mask of dst faces with obstructions
train SAE either with 'learn mask' or with 'style values'
Screenshot of mask editor: https://i.imgur.com/SaVpxVn.jpg
result of training and merging using edited mask: https://i.imgur.com/QJi9Myd.jpg
Complex masks are harder to train.

SAE: 
previous SAE model will not work with this update.
Greatly decreased chance of model collapse. 
Increased model accuracy.
Residual blocks now default and this option has been removed.
Improved 'learn mask'.
Added masked preview (switch by space key)

Converter: 
fixed rct/lct in seamless mode
added mask mode (6) learned*FAN-prd*FAN-dst

changed help message for pixel loss:
Pixel loss may help to enhance fine details and stabilize face color. Use it only if quality does not improve over time.

fixed ctrl-c exit in no-preview mode

== 03.31.2019 ==

Converter: fix blur region of seamless.

== 03.30.2019 == 

fixed seamless face jitter
removed options Suppress seamless jitter, seamless erode mask modifier.

fixed cut video.bat for paths with spaces

== 03.24.2019 ==

old SAE model will not work with this update.

Fixed bug when SAE can be collapsed during a time. 

SAE: removed CA weights and encoder/decoder dims.

added new options:

Encoder dims per channel (21-85 ?:help skip:%d) 
More encoder dims help to recognize more facial features, but require more VRAM. You can fine-tune model size to fit your GPU.

Decoder dims per channel (11-85 ?:help skip:%d) 
More decoder dims help to get better details, but require more VRAM. You can fine-tune model size to fit your GPU.

Add residual blocks to decoder? (y/n, ?:help skip:n) : 
These blocks help to get better details, but require more computing time.

Remove gray border? (y/n, ?:help skip:n) : 
Removes gray border of predicted face, but requires more computing resources.


Extract images from video: added option
Output image format? ( jpg png ?:help skip:png ) : 
PNG is lossless, but produces images with size x10 larger than JPG.
JPG extraction is faster, especially on HDD instead of SSD.

== 03.21.2019 ==

OpenCL build: fixed, now works on most video cards again.

old SAE model will not work with this update.
Fixed bug when SAE can be collapsed during a time

Added option
Use CA weights? (y/n, ?:help skip: n ) :
Initialize network with 'Convolution Aware' weights. 
This may help to achieve a higher accuracy model, but consumes time at first run.

Extractor:
removed DLIB extractor
greatly increased accuracy of landmarks extraction, especially with S3FD detector, but speed of 2nd pass now slower.
From this point on, it is recommended to use only the S3FD detector.
before https://i.imgur.com/SPGeJCm.gif
after https://i.imgur.com/VmmAm8p.gif

Converter: added new option to choose type of mask for full-face models.

Mask mode: (1) learned, (2) dst, (3) FAN-prd, (4) FAN-dst (?) help. Default - 1 : 
Learned – Learned mask, if you choose option 'Learn mask' in model. The contours are fairly smooth, but can be wobbly.
Dst – raw mask from dst face, wobbly contours.
FAN-prd – mask from pretrained FAN model from predicted face. Very smooth not shaky countours.
FAN-dst – mask from pretrained FAN model from dst face. Very smooth not shaky countours.
Advantages of FAN mask: you can get a not wobbly shaky without learning it by model.
Disadvantage of FAN mask: may produce artifacts on the contours if the face is obstructed.

== 03.13.2019 ==

SAE: added new option

Optimizer mode? ( 1,2,3 ?:help skip:1) : 
this option only for NVIDIA cards. Optimizer mode of neural network.
1 - default.
2 - allows you to train x2 bigger network, uses a lot of RAM.
3 - allows you to train x3 bigger network, uses huge amount of RAM and 30% slower.

Epoch term renamed to iteration term.
